Here's the answer to your question:\n\nFungi manage to reproduce in unfavorable conditions through a process called anastomosis, which involves the exchange of genetic material between two adjacent hyphae (filaments) of the same fungus. The particles involved in this process are called conidia, which are specialized spores that are produced by the fungus and can travel long distances to find a suitable environment for growth.",
