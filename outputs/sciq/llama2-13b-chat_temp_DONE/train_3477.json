        "1. Carbon sequestration: Oceans absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which helps to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\n2. Heat absorption: Oceans absorb heat from the sun, which helps to reduce the amount of heat that is trapped in the atmosphere.\n3. Evaporation: Oceans evaporate water vapor into the atmosphere, which helps to cool the planet.\n4. Ocean currents: Ocean currents distribute heat around the globe, which helps to regulate temperatures.",
