        "Sure! Here's the answer to your question:\n\nThe mechanism that makes a newborn baby start to breathe is the autonomic nervous system, specifically the phrenic nerves, which are responsible for controlling the baby's breathing muscles. These nerves are stimulated by the baby's brain stem, which is present at birth and functioning properly. As soon as the baby is born, the autonomic nervous system takes over and starts regulating the baby's breathing, leading to the baby's first breath.",

        "The physiological connection that triggers a baby to start breathing at birth is the sudden drop in blood oxygen levels."
