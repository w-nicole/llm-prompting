        "1. Stress concentration: As the glacier flows, stress concentrates at the points where the ice is thinnest, causing the ice to crack and form crevasses.\n2. Crystal plastic flow: As the ice crystals in the glacier deform, they can flow plastically, leading to the formation of crevasses.\n3. Basal slipping: The base of the glacier can slide over the underlying bedrock, causing the ice above it to crack and form crevasses.\n4. Iceberg calving: When large chunks of ice break off from the front of the glacier, they can create crevasses as they fall.",

        "Crevasses are formed in glaciers due to the movement of ice and the resulting stresses and strains on the glacial surface",
        "Sure! Here's the answer to your question:\n\nGlaciers form crevasses when they move downhill and the ice crystallizes, causing the glacier to crack and form deep, narrow fissures. This process is influenced by factors such as temperature, precipitation, and the glacier's speed and direction of movement."
