    "pred_ans_conf_OE": "Crevasses are formed by the movement of glacial ice as it flows downhill, causing stress and strain on the ice that ultimately leads to the formation of cracks and fissures.Crevasses are a common feature of glaciers and are formed through a combination of factors, including the movement of the glacier, changes in temperature and precipitation, and the underlying geology of the area. As the glacier moves, it can become stressed and fractured, leading to the formation of cracks and crevasses. The size and frequency of crevasses can vary depending on the size and type of glacier, as well as the local climate and geology.",

        "Sure! Here's a description of how a crevasse is formed within a glacier:\n\nA crevasse is formed when two layers of ice move at different speeds, causing a gap to form between them. As the glacier flows downhill, the weight of the ice above causes the layers to compress and the gap to widen, eventually creating a deep crack or crevasse.",
        "Sure! Here's the answer to your question:\n\nGlacial crevasses are formed through the following processes:\n\n1. Stress concentration: As the glacier flows, stress concentrates at the points where the ice is thinnest, causing the ice to crack and form crevasses.\n2. Crystal plastic flow: As the ice crystals in the glacier deform, they can flow plastically, leading to the formation of crevasses.\n3. Basal slipping: The base of the glacier can slide over the underlying bedrock, causing the ice above it to crack and form crevasses.\n4. Iceberg calving: When large chunks of ice break off from the front of the glacier, they can create crevasses as they fall.",

        "Sure! Here's the answer to your question:\n\nGlaciers form crevasses when they move downhill and the ice crystallizes, causing the glacier to crack and form deep, narrow fissures. This process is influenced by factors such as temperature, precipitation, and the glacier's speed and direction of movement."
