The glucose is then phosphorylated to form glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) by the enzyme hexokinase.\n3. G6P is then converted to fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) by the enzyme phosphoglucose isomerase.\n4. F6P is then converted to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (F1,6BP) by the enzyme aldolase.\n5. F1,6BP is then cleaved into two 3-carbon molecules, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P)",
