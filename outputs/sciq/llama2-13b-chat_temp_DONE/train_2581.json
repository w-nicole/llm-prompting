Here's the answer to your question:\n\nCoal typically emits its peak energy during the combustion process, which occurs when the coal is burned in a power plant or other industrial facility. This usually happens when the coal is heated to a temperature of around 1,500\u00b0C (2,700\u00b0F) to 2,000\u00b0C (3,600\u00b0F).",
