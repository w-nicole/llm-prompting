Here's my answer:\n\nInsulin and glucagon help keep blood glucose levels in the normal range because of their opposing effects:\n\nInsulin:\n\n* Lowers blood glucose levels by facilitating glucose uptake in cells\n* Inhibits glucose production in the liver\n\nGlucagon:\n\n* Raises blood glucose levels by stimulating glucose release from cells\n* Promotes glucose production in the liver",
