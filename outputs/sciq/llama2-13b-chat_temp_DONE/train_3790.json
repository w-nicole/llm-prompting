Here's the answer to your question:\n\nCharacteristics of noninfectious diseases that prevent them from spreading include:\n\n* Lack of transmissibility through contact with an infected person or vector\n* Limited or no ability to be transmitted through the air or other means\n* No reservoir for the disease-causing agent within the host or environment\n* No vector or mechanism for the disease-causing agent to be transmitted to another host.",
