        "Is it accurate to say that the only factors impacting the period of a simple pendulum are its length and the acceleration due to gravity, and it's completely unaffected by any other considerations?",
        "Can one affirm that the period of a simple pendulum is solely regulated by its length and gravity's acceleration, entirely disregarding other possibilities?",
        "Would it be correct to state that just the length of the pendulum and gravitational acceleration impact its period, with no other factors involved?",
        "Considering the period of a simple pendulum, would it be fair to declare that solely its length and the acceleration due to gravity have an effect, and no other elements?",
        "Is it fair to say that the period of a simple pendulum is dictated exclusively by its length and the acceleration due to gravity, and is completely detached from any other variables?",
        "Is it right to assert that only the length of a pendulum and the acceleration due to gravity affect its period, entirely putting aside other factors?",
        "Would it be exact to say that just the pendulum's length and gravity's acceleration determine its period, absolutely excluding any other influences?",
        "Is it true that the period of a simple pendulum is influenced only by its length and the acceleration of gravity, being completely independent of other factors?",
        "Is it factual to express that nothing but the length and the acceleration due to gravity impact the period of a simple pendulum, utterly disregarding other elements?",
        "Can it be authenticated that the only determinants of a simple pendulum's period are its length and gravitational acceleration, entirely separate from any other aspects?"
