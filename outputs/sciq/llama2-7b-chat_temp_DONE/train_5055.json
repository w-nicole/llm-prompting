Segmentation: Contractions that occur in the small intestine to mix food with digestive enzymes and move it through the digestive tract.\n3. Propulsion: Contractions that occur in the large intestine to move waste through the digestive system and into the rectum.",
        "Peristalsis",
        "Throughout the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, food is transported by a combination of mechanical and chemical processes. The GI tract is lined with specialized epithelial cells that secrete digestive enzymes and acids to break down food into smaller molecules. The small intestine, which is the longest part of the GI tract, is responsible for the majority of nutrient absorption. The small intestine uses a combination of peristalsis (wave-like muscle contractions) and secretions from the pancreas and liver to move food through the digestive system. Eventually, the waste products are eliminated from the body through the rectum and anus.",
