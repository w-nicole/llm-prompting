Supporting the body's weight and maintaining posture\n3. Allowing for a wide range of motion in the neck, back, and torso\n4. Facilitating the transfer of forces between the body and the ground\n5. Providing a stable base of support for the body's movements\n6. Enabling the body to maintain balance and stability during physical activity\n7. Allowing for the transmission of forces from the upper body to the lower body\n8. Supporting the body's weight and maintaining posture during dynamic movements.",
