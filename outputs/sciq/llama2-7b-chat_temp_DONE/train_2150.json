        "Sure! The tools used to balance chemical equations are:\n\n1. Moles\n2. Atomic mass numbers\n3. Chemical formulas\n4. Balance symbols (e.g. +, -, =)\n5. Subscripts",
        "Sure! Here's how to balance chemical equations:\n\n1. Write the unbalanced equation with the reactants on the left and the products on the right.\n2. Count the number of atoms of each element on both sides of the equation and identify the elements that are not balanced.\n3. Add coefficients in front of the formulas of the reactants or products to balance the equation.\n4. Check the equation to make sure that the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides.\n\nThat's it!",

Identify the elements that are present in excess and write a coefficient in front of them.\n3. Identify the elements that are missing and write a coefficient in front of them.\n4. Check that the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of the equation.\n5. If necessary, make adjustments to the coefficients to balance the equation.\n6. Write the balanced equation with the correct coefficients.",
