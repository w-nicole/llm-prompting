Significance levels: Reported as a probability value (e.g., p < 0.05) indicating the level of statistical significance.\n5. Uncertainty: Reported as a range of values, or as an estimate of the uncertainty in the measurement.\n6. Units: Clearly identified and consistent throughout the report or presentation.\n7. Trends and patterns: Highlighted through visual representations, such as graphs, charts, or plots."
