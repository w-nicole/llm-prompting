        "1. Gradual weakening of the glacier due to temperature changes or other factors\n2. Crevasse formation begins with small cracks and fissures in the glacier's surface\n3. As the glacier continues to move and deform, these cracks and fissures grow and deepen\n4. Crevasses can also form at the glacier's edges, where the ice meets the land or water\n5. As the glacier continues to flow, crevasses can become larger and more numerous\n6. Crevasses can also intersect and create complex networks of ice fissures\n7. The formation of crevasses is an ongoing process, as the glacier continues to deform and change over time.",

        "Crevasses are formed when glacial ice crystals undergo a process called basal slip. This occurs when the ice crystals at the base of the glacier begin to move horizontally, creating cracks and crevasses in the ice.",
        "1. Temperature: Glaciers form in cold environments, typically below 0\u00b0C (32\u00b0F).\n2. Snow accumulation: Snow accumulates over time and compresses under its own weight, forming a glacier.\n3. Ice flow: Glaciers move due to gravity, and as they flow, they experience stress and deformation, leading to the formation of crevasses.\n4. Fracture: The glacier fractures or cracks due to the stress and deformation, creating crevasses.\n5. Water flow: Meltwater from the glacier flows through the crevasses, deepening them.\n6. Time: The process of crevassing occurs over time as the glacier continues to move and deform."
