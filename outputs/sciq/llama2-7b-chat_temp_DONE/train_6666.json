        "Prokaryotes, such as bacteria, do not have a reproductive cycle in the classical sense. They reproduce asexually through a process called binary fission, in which the cell divides into two daughter cells. This process occurs when the cell reaches a certain size and the cell wall begins to crack, allowing the cell to split in half. Each new daughter cell is a genetic clone of the parent cell, containing the same genetic material. This process of binary fission is repeated continuously in prokaryotes, resulting in rapid growth and multiplication.",
