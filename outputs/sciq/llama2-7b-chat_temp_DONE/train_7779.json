        "The newborn baby initiates the process of breathing through the following steps:\n\n1. The baby's brain sends a signal to the diaphragm to contract and move downward.\n2. The diaphragm contracts and flattens, causing the rib cage to expand and the lungs to fill with air.\n3. The baby's airways relax, allowing air to flow into the lungs.\n4. The baby's lungs expand and contract, pulling air in and pushing it out.\n\nThis process is automatic and happens without the baby consciously controlling it.",
        "The signal or connection that ignites the breathing process in a newborn baby is the respiratory center in the brain, specifically the medullary region of the pons.",
        "Brain stem",
        "The baby starts breathing right after birth through a natural reflex called the \"newborn reflex.\" This reflex is triggered by the pressure of the baby's face on the birth canal during delivery, which stimulates the baby's brain to initiate breathing. The baby's lungs are already developed and ready to function properly, and the reflexive breathing pattern helps the baby to take in oxygen and expel carbon dioxide.",
        "The umbilical cord",
        "The baby's airway needs to be clear and free of any obstructions for the baby to start breathing at birth.",
        "The brain",
        "Cilia movement",
        "The newborn baby begins breathing on its own within a few minutes after birth, triggered by the presence of oxygen in the air.",
        "The physiological connection that triggers a baby to start breathing at birth is the release of oxytocin from the pituitary gland."
