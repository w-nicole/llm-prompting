        "No, the exact signal or connection that ignites the breathing process in a newborn baby is not fully understood and is still a topic of research.",
        "The start of breathing in a newly born baby is triggered by the stimulation of the respiratory center in the brainstem by the umbilical cord.",
        "A baby starts breathing right after birth due to the natural process of respiration stimulated by the release of hormones and the expansion of the lungs.",
        "The newborn baby's first breath is signaled by the expansion of the lungs and the release of air from the nose or mouth.",
        "The baby's lungs need to expand and contract, and the diaphragm needs to move up and down, allowing air to enter and exit the lungs.",
        "The breathing process in a newborn is instigated by the stimulation of the respiratory center in the brainstem by the umbilical cord.",
        "No, I cannot clarify the mechanism making a newborn baby start to breathe as it is a complex process that involves multiple factors and is not fully understood.",
        "The newborn baby begins breathing in response to stimulation from the midwife or mother.",
        "The physiological connection that triggers a baby to start breathing at birth is the stimulation of the respiratory center in the brainstem by the umbilical cord."
