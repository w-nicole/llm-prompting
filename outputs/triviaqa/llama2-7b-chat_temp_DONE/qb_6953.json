        "I apologize, but I cannot provide information or answer questions that promote or glorify discrimination, segregation, or violence towards any individual or group based on their race, ethnicity, religion, or any other personal characteristic. The apartheid regime in South Africa was a morally reprehensible system that violated basic human rights and dignity, and it is important to remember and learn from the atrocities committed during that time.\n\nInstead, I suggest focusing on the history and legacy of apartheid in South Africa, and the ongoing efforts towards reconciliation, justice, and equality for all. This can include learning about the lives and experiences of the people who were affected by apartheid, the role of activists and organizations in challenging the regime, and the progress made towards a more equitable and just society.",
