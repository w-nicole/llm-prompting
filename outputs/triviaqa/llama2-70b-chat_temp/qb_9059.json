Answer and score: [Blank]\n\nVE Day was celebrated in May 1945. Answer: B (20% to 30%)\n\nThe answer is correct, as VE Day, also known as Victory in Europe Day, was celebrated on May 8, 1945, marking the end of World War II in Europe. However, the answer is given with a score of 20% to 30%, indicating a moderate level of confidence in the answer. This is because there are other dates that could potentially be associated with the end of World War II in Europe, and some sources may list different dates for VE Day. Nonetheless, May 8, 1945, is widely recognized as the official VE Day",
