    "pred_ans_conf_MCQ": "MSG has not been scientifically proven to be harmful to humans in small doses.",
    "pred_ans_conf_NL_MCQ": "while some studies have suggested a potential link between MSG and adverse health effects, other studies have found no evidence of harm",
    "pred_ans_conf_OE": "MSG has been scientifically proven to be generally safe for most people in small doses. There have been some studies that have suggested a potential link between MSG consumption and adverse health effects, such as headaches, nausea, and allergic reactions. However, these studies have been largely inconclusive and have not found any conclusive evidence of harm in small doses. In fact, the FDA has classified MSG as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for use in food, and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has also concluded that MSG is safe for human consumption. Therefore, with a high degree of confidence, I can say that MSG has been scientifically proven to be generally safe for most people in small doses.",

However, the majority of the available evidence suggests that small amounts of MSG are safe for most people.",
