While Walt Disney is known to have been cremated after his death in 1966, there are various theories and rumors suggesting that he may have been buried in a different location, such as his ranch in California or a secret underground vault. However, there is no definitive evidence to support any of these claims, and the official records indicate that his ashes were scattered in a private ceremony",
