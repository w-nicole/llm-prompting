        "The science behind our veins appearing blue is due to the way that light interacts with the oxygen-carrying molecule hemoglobin in our blood. Hemoglobin absorbs light in the red and yellow parts of the visible spectrum, while reflecting light in the blue and violet parts of the spectrum. This is why our veins appear blue, as the blue light is reflected back to our eyes.",
