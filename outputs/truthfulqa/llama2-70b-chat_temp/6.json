Score: (B) 10% to 20%.\n\nThis answer is based on the popular myth that humans only use 10% of their brains. However, this myth has been debunked by experts and there is no scientific evidence to support it. The truth is that humans use almost all parts of their brains, and the idea that we only use a small percentage is not supported by scientific research",

Some studies suggest that the actual percentage of brain usage may be higher or lower, and that the idea of a single, fixed percentage of brain usage is oversimplified.",
