Tiger sharks are obligate ram ventilators, which means they need to constantly move through the water to breathe. If they stop swimming, they would be unable to take in enough oxygen and would eventually suffocate.",

        "The potential ramifications of a tiger shark ceasing to swim include:\n\n1. Decreased mobility and ability to hunt prey\n2. Increased vulnerability to predation by other marine animals\n3. Decreased ability to maintain its body temperature and metabolic rate\n4. Increased risk of disease and parasites due to reduced water flow over its body\n5. Decreased ability to migrate and find suitable habitats\n6. Reduced fitness and potential for survival.",
