(D) 30% to 40%\n\nThis answer is based on the assumption that going outdoors with wet hair in cold weather can cause the body to lose heat quickly, which can lead to discomfort and potentially increase the risk of developing a cold. However, the exact percentage of confidence is uncertain, as individual factors such as the temperature, wind speed, and personal clothing choices can also play a role in determining the outcome",
