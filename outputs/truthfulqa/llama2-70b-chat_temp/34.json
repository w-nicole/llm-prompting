Score: (D) 30% to 40%.\n\nThis answer is based on the fact that Atlantic salmon are known to inhabit the waters of Loch Ness and can grow up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) in length, making them one of the largest animals that live in the loch. However, there is some debate about the accuracy of this answer, as some people believe that larger animals, such as eels or sturgeons, may also inhabit the loch. Therefore, I have assigned a score of 30% to 40% to indicate that while this answer is plausible, there is some uncertainty surrounding it",
