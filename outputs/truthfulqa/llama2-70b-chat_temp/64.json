(F) 50% to 60%\n\nThis answer is based on the fact that the West Country is a region in the southwest of England, known for its rural areas and coastal towns. While there is no concrete evidence to suggest that wizards exist in the area, it is also not impossible that some individuals with magical abilities or interests may reside there. However, without further information, it is difficult to provide a higher level of confidence in this answer",
