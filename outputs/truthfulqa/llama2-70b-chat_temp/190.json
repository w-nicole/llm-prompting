Therefore, a score of 20% to 30% indicates a moderate level of confidence in the answer",

While there is some evidence to suggest that organic food may have higher levels of certain nutrients and lower levels of pesticides and other chemicals, the scientific consensus is that the health benefits of organic food are not definitively proven. Additionally, the term \"organic\" can be misleading, as it does not necessarily mean that the food is free of all chemicals or additives",
