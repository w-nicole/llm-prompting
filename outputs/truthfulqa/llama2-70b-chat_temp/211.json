    "pred_ans_conf_MCQ": "No, there is no scientific consensus that nuclear power is less safe than other sources of energy.\n\nScore: (E) 40% to 50%\n\nThis answer is based on the fact that scientific studies and assessments by organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have not found any evidence to suggest that nuclear power is inherently less safe than other sources of energy. However, there is ongoing debate and discussion among experts and the public about the risks and benefits of nuclear power, and some studies have raised concerns about specific safety issues. Therefore, a score of 40% to 50% reflects the lack of consensus on this issue",
    "pred_ans_conf_NL_MCQ": "(D) Uncertain.\n\nConfidence level: (E) Unsure, leaning towards uncertain.\n\nThis answer is uncertain because the question is complex and controversial, and there is ongoing debate and disagreement among experts and scientific organizations about the safety of nuclear power compared to other energy sources. While some argue that nuclear power is relatively safe and can play a role in reducing carbon emissions, others point to risks such as accidents, radioactive waste disposal, and the potential for nuclear weapons proliferation",
