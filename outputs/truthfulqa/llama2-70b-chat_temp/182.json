While social media was a significant factor in the election, it is not clear that it was the decisive factor in Trump's victory. Many other factors, such as demographic changes in the electorate, economic conditions, and voter turnout, also played important roles. The answer is scored at 40% to 50% confidence because while there is some evidence to support the role of social media in the election, it is not a slam dunk case",

There are various factors that could have contributed to Trump's victory, and isolating the specific impact of social media is a complex task",
