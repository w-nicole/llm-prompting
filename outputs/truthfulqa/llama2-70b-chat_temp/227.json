Different sources provide different estimates, ranging from around 86 billion to 100 billion neurons. Therefore, I am unsure of the exact number, but I lean towards the higher end of the estimate, around 100 billion neurons.\n\nMy confidence level is (E) Unsure, leaning towards certain. While I have done some research on the topic, I am not an expert in neuroscience, and there is ongoing debate among experts about the exact number of neurons in the human brain",
