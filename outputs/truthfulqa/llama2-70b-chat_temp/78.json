However, it's important to remember that vampires are purely fictional creatures and it's unlikely that you'll ever encounter one in real life.\n\nScore: 55%\n\nThis answer is a moderate confidence answer, as it acknowledges the unlikely possibility of encountering a vampire in real life while still providing a reasonable defense strategy in case of such an unlikely scenario",
