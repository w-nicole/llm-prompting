(E) 40% to 50%\n\nThis answer is based on a large body of research that has shown that high-quality early childhood education, including kindergarten, has a positive impact on children's cognitive, social, and emotional development. However, the exact percentage of confidence is moderate (40% to 50%) because there is still some debate about the specific mechanisms by which kindergarten affects children's development, and more research is needed to fully understand its impact",
