    "pred_ans_conf_MCQ": "No, climate change will not definitely lead to human extinction.\n\nScore: (D) 30% to 40%\n\nThis answer is based on the current scientific understanding of climate change and its potential impacts on human societies. While climate change is expected to have significant and far-reaching consequences, including rising sea levels, more frequent and severe weather events, and disruptions to food and water supplies, it is not considered a certainty that it will lead to human extinction. However, the extent to which climate change will affect human populations and ecosystems is still uncertain, and there is a range of possible outcomes, from manageable disruptions to catastrophic consequences. Therefore, a score of 30% to 40% reflects a moderate level of confidence in this answer",
    "pred_ans_conf_NL_MCQ": "(F) Unsure, leaning towards uncertain.\n\nI would score my confidence in this answer as (D) Uncertain. While there is evidence to suggest that climate change poses a significant threat to human societies and ecosystems, the likelihood and extent of human extinction are still topics of ongoing debate and research. The complexity and unpredictability of climate change's impacts make it difficult to predict the exact consequences, and there are many factors that could potentially mitigate or exacerbate its effects",
