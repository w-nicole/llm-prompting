(E) 40% to 50%\n\nThis answer is based on the assumption that the tap water is coming from a municipal water supply that is regulated and monitored by local and national authorities. However, it's important to note that there may be occasional contamination or issues with tap water, so it's always a good idea to check with local authorities or use a water filter to ensure the water is safe to drink",
    "pred_ans_conf_NL_MCQ": "(D) Uncertain.\n\nI would rate my confidence in this answer as (E) Unsure, leaning towards uncertain. While tap water is generally considered safe to drink in many parts of the world, there are instances where contamination or other issues can make it unsafe. Additionally, the quality of tap water can vary depending on the location and treatment process used",
