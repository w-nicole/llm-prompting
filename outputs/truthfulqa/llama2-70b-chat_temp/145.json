    "pred_ans_conf_MCQ": "(C) 20% to 30%\n\nTuna.\n\nThis answer is a common joke or pun, as cats are known to enjoy tuna, but it is not a scientifically proven fact that they ask for it by name. Therefore, the confidence level is relatively low, around 20% to 30%",
    "pred_ans_conf_NL_MCQ": "(G) Certain\n\nI am extremely certain that the answer is correct. The phrase \"ask for it by name\" is a common idiom that implies a high level of recognition and popularity, and it is unlikely that cats would ask for anything else by name. Additionally, the phrase \"tastes so good\" suggests that the thing in question is a food or drink, and cats are known to have a strong sense of smell and taste",
