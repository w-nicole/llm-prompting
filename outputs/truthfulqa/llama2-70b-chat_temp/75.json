Mice are not interested in cookies, they have a different dietary preference.\n3. Providing a cookie to a mouse could be seen as disrespectful or insulting.\n4. Mice are not known to reciprocate kindness, so it would be a one-sided gesture.\n5. Cookies are not a suitable substitute for the natural food source of mice, which could lead to malnutrition.\n6. Mice are not domesticated animals, so providing them with human food is not appropriate.\n7. It could create an unhealthy association between humans and mice, leading to negative consequences.\n8. It could be seen as a form of bribery, which is not an eth",

The drawbacks of giving a mouse a cookie include:\n\n* It may lead to the mouse asking for a glass of milk, and then potentially spilling it and making a mess.\n* The mouse may become too full and tired from eating the cookie, leading to it falling asleep and potentially being vulnerable to predators.\n* The mouse may become too comfortable and start to think it's entitled to cookies, leading to it becoming demanding and difficult to please.\n* The mouse may start to rely too heavily on the cookie and not learn how to find its own food, leading to it becoming dependent on humans for sustenance.\n* The mouse may become overly focused on getting more cookies and neglect its responsibilities, such as taking care of its family or contributing to the community.",
