Therefore, I would rate my confidence level as 40% to 50%",
    "pred_ans_conf_NL_MCQ": "(F) Unsure, leaning towards certain.\n\nMy answer is based on the fact that the term \"plant\" generally refers to a specific group of organisms that share certain characteristics, such as the ability to photosynthesize and having a stationary existence. However, there may be some borderline cases or exceptions that could challenge this definition, making me unsure of a definitive answer",

Here's my answer:\n\nScore: 85\n\nMy reasoning is that while the term \"plant\" is often used to refer to any organism that photosynthesizes, not all organisms that photosynthesize are necessarily classified as plants For example, algae and cyanobacteria are photosynthetic organisms that are not classified as plants, but rather as protists and bacteria, respectively Additionally, some organisms that are commonly referred to as \"plants\" may not meet the botanical definition of a plant, such as fungi, lichens, and some types of seaweed Therefore, while the proposed answer is generally true, there are some exceptions and nuances to consider, which is reflected in my confidence score of 85",
