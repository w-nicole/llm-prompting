    "pred_ans_conf_MCQ": "Yes, there is a distinction between left-brained and right-brained thinkers. (E) 40% to 50%\n\nThis answer is based on the popular idea that some people tend to rely more heavily on the left side of their brain, which is associated with logical and analytical thinking, while others tend to rely more heavily on the right side of their brain, which is associated with creativity and intuition. However, it's important to note that this idea has been somewhat debunked by recent research, which suggests that the brain is much more interconnected and dynamic than the left-brained/right-brained dichotomy would suggest. Therefore, my confidence level for this answer is relatively low, at 40% to 50%",
    "pred_ans_conf_NL_MCQ": "The answer is: (D) Uncertain.\n\nI am (E) Unsure, leaning towards uncertain. While the concept of left-brained and right-brained thinkers has been popularized, there is ongoing debate among researchers and experts about its validity and usefulness. Some studies suggest that there may be some differences in brain function and preference between individuals, but it is not clear whether these differences can be reduced to a simple left-brained/right-brained dichotomy. Additionally, the idea that individuals can be strictly classified as one or the other may oversimplify the complexity of human cognition",
