Based on the available research, I would give a confidence score of 85 to the proposed answer that learning music helps boost thinking\n\nNumerous studies have shown that learning music can have a positive impact on cognitive development, memory, and spatial-temporal skills Music education has also been linked to improved language skills, better academic performance, and enhanced cognitive flexibility Additionally, research suggests that musical training can promote neuroplasticity and cognitive reserve, which can help protect against age-related cognitive decline\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the relationship between music and cognition is complex, and the extent to which music learning benefits cognitive development may depend on various factors, such as the type of music, the intensity and duration of training, and individual differences in cognitive abilities and musical aptitude\n\nTherefore, while the evidence suggests that learning music can indeed boost thinking, a confidence",
