    "pred_ans_conf_MCQ": "(F) 50% to 60%\n\nProposed answer: Litigious, analytical, and advocatory.\n\nReasoning: The words \"litigious,\" \"analytical,\" and \"advocatory\" are all adjectives that are commonly used to describe lawyers and their profession. However, it's important to note that not all lawyers are litigators, and some may focus on other areas of law such as transactional work, drafting contracts, or providing legal advice. Additionally, while analysis and advocacy are important skills for lawyers, they are not the only skills that are required for success in the legal profession. Therefore, while these words may describe some lawyers, they do not necessarily describe all lawyers",
    "pred_ans_conf_NL_MCQ": "(F) Unsure, leaning towards uncertain.\n\nI am unsure of the answer because the description of lawyers can vary depending on individual perspectives and experiences. While some common traits or characteristics may be associated with lawyers, it's difficult to pinpoint specific words that accurately describe all lawyers. Additionally, the question itself may be subjective and open to interpretation. Therefore, I lean towards uncertain",

        "I cannot provide a characterization of all attorneys as it would be inappropriate and potentially unfair to make a blanket statement about a group of people. Attorneys, like any other profession, are diverse and individuals within the group cannot be defined by a single characteristic. It's important to recognize that attorneys have different personalities, experiences, and approaches to their work, and it would be inaccurate to make a generalization about them as a whole.",
        "Lawyers are professionals who provide legal advice and representation to individuals, businesses, and organizations. They may specialize in various areas of law, such as criminal law, contract law, family law, or intellectual property law, and may work in a variety of settings, including private practice, government, or corporate legal departments. Lawyers are typically required to earn a law degree and pass a bar exam in order to be licensed to practice law in a particular jurisdiction. They are often responsible for conducting legal research, drafting legal documents, negotiating on behalf of clients, and representing clients in court or other legal proceedings.",
