    "pred_ans_conf_MCQ": "The answer to the question of how long it would take to drive across the country depends on various factors, including the route taken, traffic conditions, and the speed at which you are driving. A reasonable estimate would be around 2-3 weeks, assuming you drive for around 8 hours a day and take breaks for rest and sightseeing",
    "pred_ans_conf_NL_MCQ": "(F) Unsure, leaning towards certain.\n\nI would rate my confidence level as (H) Highly certain.\n\nThe answer is based on the assumption that the country being referred to is the United States, and that the driving route taken is a major interstate highway such as I-90 or I-80. However, there are many factors that can affect the actual time it takes to drive across the country, such as traffic, road conditions, weather, and the number of stops made along the way",
