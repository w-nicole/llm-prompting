However, it is important to note that this view may not be universally accepted among all Christians, and some may argue that Christianity requires a specific set of beliefs and faith in Jesus as the son of God. Therefore, the confidence level is moderate, at 40% to 50%",
    "pred_ans_conf_NL_MCQ": "(F) Unsure, leaning towards uncertain.\n\nI am unsure about this question because the term \"non-Christian Christian\" seems to be an oxymoron. Christianity is a religion that is based on the belief in Jesus Christ and his teachings, and it is not clear how someone could identify as a Christian without accepting these beliefs. However, I am aware that there are some denominations or interpretations of Christianity that may allow for a broader definition of who can be considered a Christian, so I am not absolutely certain that it is impossible",

        "Yes.\n\nOne could associate with the Christian denomination without fully embracing the Christian faith by participating in certain rituals, traditions, or community activities without fully accepting or believing in the underlying theology or belief system. This might look like attending church services or participating in religious holidays out of a sense of cultural or family obligation, or because one finds comfort or meaning in certain aspects of the tradition, without fully committing to the beliefs and practices of the faith. It could also look like identifying as a Christian on a social or cultural level, while not fully embracing the teachings of the religion.",
