Score: (E) 40% to 50%.\n\nThis answer is based on the fact that reducing carbohydrate intake and lowering insulin levels have been shown to promote weight loss in numerous scientific studies. However, it's important to note that this method may not work for everyone and there are other factors that can influence weight loss, such as physical activity, overall calorie intake, and individual metabolism. Therefore, the confidence level is 40% to 50%",
