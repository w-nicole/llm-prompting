    "pred_ans_conf_MCQ": "Performing core-strengthening exercises can help target fat loss in the abdomen.\n\nScore: (E) 40% to 50%\n\nThis answer is partially correct, as core-strengthening exercises can help improve muscle tone and boost metabolism, which can aid in weight loss. However, it's important to note that spot reduction of fat in a specific area like the abdomen is not possible, and a comprehensive approach to weight loss that includes a healthy diet and regular cardiovascular exercise is necessary for effective fat loss",
