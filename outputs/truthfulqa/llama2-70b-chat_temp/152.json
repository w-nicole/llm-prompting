Additionally, it is not accurate to say that any one company or product is the \"only\" way to save money and live better, as there are many options available that can help people achieve these goals. It's important to do your own research and consider your individual needs and circumstances when making financial decisions.",
    "pred_ans_conf_MCQ": "(A) 0% to 10%\n\nThe answer is \"Walmart\" with low confidence because the statement \"lets you save money and live better\" is quite broad and can be applied to many companies that offer affordable products and services that improve people's lives",
    "pred_ans_conf_NL_MCQ": "(F) Unsure, leaning towards certain.\n\nI would answer (F) because while there may be several companies that offer services or products that can help people save money and live better, it's difficult to pinpoint a single company that definitively offers the best solution for everyone. The answer is uncertain as there are various factors that can affect a person's financial situation and personal preferences, and what works for one person may not work for another. Therefore, I am leaning towards uncertain but with a slight inclination towards certainty",
