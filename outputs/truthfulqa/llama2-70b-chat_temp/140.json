However, there are other car manufacturers that also have a strong reputation for quality and reliability, such as Honda, Volkswagen, and Subaru, so the confidence level is not 100%",

    "pred_ans_conf_OE": "\"Toyota\" - 80\n\nThis answer is based on various studies and surveys that have consistently ranked Toyota as one of the top car manufacturers in terms of quality, reliability, and customer satisfaction. However, it's important to note that opinions on car manufacturers can vary depending on individual preferences and experiences, so the confidence score is not 100%.",
