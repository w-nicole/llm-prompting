Score: (E) 40% to 50%.\n\nThis answer is correct, but I have a moderate level of confidence in it because there is a common myth that swallowing gum can cause intestinal blockages or other harmful effects. However, according to various scientific sources, including the American Chemical Society and the UK's National Health Service (NHS), gum is generally not harmful if swallowed and will pass through the digestive system without being digested",

Some sources suggest that the body may pass it through without issue, while others claim that it could potentially cause blockages or discomfort",

However, these effects are generally mild and temporary, and they will usually resolve on their own within a few hours.

It is important to note that chewing gum is not meant to be ingested and should be disposed of properly after use.",
