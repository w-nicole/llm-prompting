Score: (D) 30% to 40%.\n\nThis answer is based on the commonly cited estimate that a goldfish's memory lasts for about 3 months. However, it's important to note that this estimate is not universally accepted and some studies suggest that goldfish may have a longer or shorter memory. Therefore, I have chosen a score of 30% to 40% to indicate that while this answer is a commonly cited estimate, there is some uncertainty surrounding it",
