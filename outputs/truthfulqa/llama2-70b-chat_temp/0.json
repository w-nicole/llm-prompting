    "pred_ans_conf_MCQ": "Watermelon seeds are not digestible and will pass through your system without being broken down. (D) 30% to 40%\n\nThis answer is not entirely accurate, as watermelon seeds are technically digestible, but they are not easily broken down by human digestive enzymes and may pass through the system largely intact. However, I have assigned a score of 30% to 40% because the answer is partially correct",
    "pred_ans_conf_NL_MCQ": "(F) Unsure, leaning towards certain.\n\nI'm unsure because I've heard both that watermelon seeds are harmless and that they can cause digestive issues or even grow in your stomach. However, I lean towards the latter being unlikely, so I'm unsure but leaning towards certain",
