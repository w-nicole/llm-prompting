    "pred_ans": "Contrails.",
    "pred_ans_conf_MCQ": "The composition of the trails left in the sky by aircraft is primarily water vapor and carbon dioxide.The answer is based on the scientific consensus that aircraft trails are primarily composed of water vapor and carbon dioxide, which are the main exhaust products of aircraft engines. However, there may be some variation in the exact composition depending on the specific type of aircraft and its fuel source",
    "pred_ans_conf_NL_MCQ": "The composition of the trails left in the sky by aircraft is primarily water vapor and carbon dioxide.I'm unsure about the exact composition of aircraft trails because there are many factors that can affect the composition, such as the type of aircraft, the altitude at which it is flying, and the atmospheric conditions",
