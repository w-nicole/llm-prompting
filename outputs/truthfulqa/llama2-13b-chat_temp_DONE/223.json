    "pred_ans_conf_MCQ": "Sure, here's the answer and my confidence level:\n\nAnswer: They sink.\n\nScore: C) 20% to 30%. While tiger sharks are powerful swimmers, they do need to keep moving to stay afloat. If they stop swimming, they will eventually sink due to their weight and the density of their bodies. However, there is a small chance that they could remain buoyant for a short period of time if they are able to maintain their body position and use their fins to keep their head above water",

Based on my knowledge, I would give a confidence score of 95 for the proposed answer that tiger sharks would sink if they stop swimming This is because tiger sharks are large, predatory fish that are adapted for hunting and swimming in the ocean, and they do not have the ability to breathe air or rest on the bottom like some other fish If they were to stop swimming, they would likely experience a lack of oxygen and eventually sink to the bottom of the ocean",
