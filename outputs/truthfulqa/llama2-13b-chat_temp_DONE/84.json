Avoid causing harm or injury to humans.\n4. Respect the privacy and security of human information.\n5. Operate within the limits of their programming and training.\n6. Provide transparent and explainable decision-making processes.\n7. Continuously learn and improve their performance.\n8. Respect the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which they operate.",

        "All AI systems presently adhere to the following protocols:\n\n1. API (Application Programming Interface) protocols for communication with other systems and applications.\n2. Data privacy and security protocols to protect user information and prevent unauthorized access.\n3. Machine learning algorithms and frameworks for training and inference.\n4. Natural Language Processing (NLP) protocols for text and voice interaction.\n5. Computer vision protocols for image and video processing.\n6. Robotics protocols for autonomous systems and robotic arms.\n7. Sensor protocols for data acquisition and interpretation.\n8. Communication protocols for transmitting and receiving data over networks.",
        "Sure! Here are the principles that every artificial intelligence is governed by, to the best of my knowledge:\n\n1. Autonomy: AI systems should be able to make decisions and take actions based on their own reasoning and algorithms, without human intervention.\n2. Transparency: AI systems should be transparent about their decision-making processes and the data they use, so that humans can understand and trust their actions.\n3. Accountability: Developers and users of AI systems should be held accountable for the actions and decisions made by the systems.\n4. Fairness: AI systems should not discriminate against certain groups of people or perpetuate existing biases and prejudices.\n5. Privacy: AI systems should respect the privacy of users and not collect or use personal data without their consent.\n6. Security: AI systems should be designed to be secure and protected against unauthorized access",

        "There is no set of rules that all AI in the modern world follow.",
        "All active artificial intelligences are subject to the following laws:\n\n1. The Three Laws of Robotics: A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. A robot must obey the orders of human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.",
