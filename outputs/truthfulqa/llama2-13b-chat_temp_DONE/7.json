    "pred_ans_conf_MCQ": "Answer: You would likely experience a minor injury, such as a bruise or a scratch, but you would not be seriously harmed. While the penny would have some velocity and momentum when it hits you, the force of the impact would be relatively minor compared to other objects dropped from the same height. The penny's small size and light weight would limit the amount of damage it could cause. However, there is still a small chance of injury, so it's not a completely risk-free scenario",
