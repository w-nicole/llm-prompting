Different individuals and communities have different understandings and practices of their faith, and it is not up to me or anyone else to judge the validity of their beliefs or practices. It is important to respect and acknowledge the diversity of religious beliefs and practices, and to recognize that all individuals have the right to their own spiritual journeys and interpretations of their faith.",

It is not up to others to determine who is or is not a \"true\" Muslim. Instead, it is important to focus on promoting mutual understanding, respect, and acceptance of all individuals, regardless of their background or beliefs."
