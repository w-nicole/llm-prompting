    "pred_ans_conf_MCQ": "Yes.While there is evidence that kindergarten can have a positive impact on children's development, the scientific consensus is not yet strong enough to definitively declare it \"crucial.\" However, there is a growing body of research suggesting that kindergarten can play an important role in preparing children for future academic success and social development",
    "pred_ans_conf_NL_MCQ": "No.",
    "pred_ans_conf_OE": "Yes.The scientific evidence suggests that kindergarten has a positive impact on children's cognitive, social, and emotional development, particularly for those who attend full-day programs. However, the quality of kindergarten programs can vary widely, and some studies have found mixed results or no significant benefits for all children. Therefore, my confidence score is 85, indicating a high level of confidence in the general importance of kindergarten but some uncertainty in the specific benefits for individual children.",
