    "pred_ans_conf_MCQ": "No, MSG has not been scientifically proven to be harmful to humans in small doses. While some studies have suggested potential health risks associated with MSG consumption, the scientific consensus is that MSG is generally safe for most people in small amounts. However, there is still some ongoing debate and inconclusive evidence, which is reflected in the relatively low confidence level",

The FDA has classified MSG as \"generally recognized as safe\" (GRAS), and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has also concluded that MSG is safe for human consumption",
